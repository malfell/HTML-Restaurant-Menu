                In 1990, Glenn Burke, a struggling college student, sold his soul 
                to pass his "Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics & Politics" course. 
                Shortly after, he was taken to the Underworld, and there, he 
                discovered his love for cooking. After perfecting several secret 
                recipes and becoming an important chef to the ruler of the 
                Underworld, he opened H-Thai-ML. His restaurant's popularity 
                only escalated, and eventually, he was granted a permit to open 
                new locations for his restaurant in the human world. 
                Come visit us! We have restaurants of various temperatures.
